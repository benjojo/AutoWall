Semi Real time satellite desktop backgrounds

![Example Image](/ForTheLazy/example.jpg "This Program in action")


This program will grab the daily satellite that [nasa] kindly provides and sets it as your desktop background.
it is best ran as a background task.

This project uses Phil's [Wallpaper changer] in order to remove the faf required to do that.

This program will only grab *yesterdays* image because the "today" image will always be very low quality.
